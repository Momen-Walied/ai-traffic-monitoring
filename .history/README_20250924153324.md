This project isn't just about counting cars. It's an intelligent, scalable system designed to understand, analyze, and predict the pulse of urban traffic. Using state-of-the-art computer vision and machine learning, we turn raw video feeds into actionable insights for smarter, safer, and more efficient cities.

## ✨ Core Features

* **🚦 Dynamic Vehicle Tracking:** Detect, count, and classify vehicles (cars, trucks, buses, bikes) with high accuracy in real-time.
* **📈 Predictive Flow Analysis:** Go beyond simple counting. Our ML models forecast congestion hotspots and traffic patterns before they even happen.
* **📸 Automatic License Plate Recognition (ANPR):** A high-speed, optional module for security, tolling, and access control.
* **⚡ Real-Time Speed Estimation:** Accurately clock vehicle speeds to monitor traffic flow velocity and identify dangerous driving.
* **📊 Intuitive Analytics Dashboard:** A beautiful, interactive web dashboard to visualize all the data, from live camera feeds to historical trends.
* **💾 Robust Data Logging:** Store and query historical traffic data for in-depth, long-term urban planning and analysis.
